###**Coding-Quiz-gt-ft-04**###


*This Coding Quiz was created to help us flex our knowledge in JavaScript and to give us "real world" experience as I proceed in my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

**This application creates a a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. 

###**Acceptance Criteria**###
